description: In this webinar originally broadcast live in partnership with RStudio
  Community, [Nick Strayer](http://nickstrayer.me) joins Eric and Curtis to share
  the awesome possibilities when combining the power of javascript with Shiny!  Nick
  shares the origins of his amazing [`{shinysense}`](http://nickstrayer.me/shinysense)
  package for linking many mobile device interactions with Shiny, and we go hands-on
  with practical demonstrations of leveraging [`{r2d3}`](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3)
  to quickly prototype D3 javascript visualizations directly in R. If you would like
  to continue the discussion please visit the dedicated [thread](https://community.rstudio.com/t/follow-up-thread-for-webinar-shinysense-and-custom-javascript-visualizations/39767)
