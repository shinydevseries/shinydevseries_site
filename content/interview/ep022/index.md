date: '2021-07-16'
description: Earlier this year at RStudio Global, a lot of excitement among the Shiny
  enthusiasts centered on the brand new bslib and thematic packages for radically
  changing the style of typical Shiny app user interfaces. I am thrilled to get the
  inside story on this amazing development with the brilliant author, RStudio software
  engineer Carson Sievert! In this episode you will hear Carson's recommendations
  on getting started with bslib for both Shiny applications and even R-Markdown documents,
  why SASS (no, not that one) rules empower a Shiny developer to make sweeping changes
  in CSS, as well as the major milestone release of shinymeta, a package that directly
  addresses a huge need for traceable and reproducible analyses from Shiny apps in
  many industries such as life sciences. I hope you enjoy this episode and don't forget
  to subscribe to our channel so you can be first to know when future episodes are
  available!
