description: One of my biggest joys of the Shiny Developer Series is watching the
  journeys of many innovations in the Shiny ecosystem from the brilliant community
  of developers and practitioners. It is my great pleasure in episode 25 to welcome
  back data scientist & software engineer Colin Fay! Picking up from his last appearance
  almost three years ago, Colin takes us through the journey of authoring the recently-published
  Engineering Production Shiny and his favorite principles covered in the book. We
  also discuss the uptake of golem in the R community, his new approaches to starting
  development of a Shiny app integrating customized HTML templates, and even a little
  real-time consulting on using his brand-new brochure package for a fun learning
  project!
