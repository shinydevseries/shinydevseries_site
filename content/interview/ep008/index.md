description: In this last webinar of the Shiny Developer Series for 2019, we are joined
  by [Nathan Teetor](https://twitter.com/ntweetor) of [ZevRoss Spatial Analysis](https://www.zevross.com)
  for an illuminating conversation about his yonder package!  Nathan shares how yonder
  is not a full-on replacement of Shiny, but rather a collection of new functionality
  built on the Shiny engine.  Plus some great demonstrations of key user interface
  features and plans for future development.  Visit the follow-up  [thread](https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-developer-series-webinar-discussion-episode-8-nathan-teetor-on-exploring-yonder/46744)
  on [RStudio Community!](https://community.rstudio.com) to continue the discussion!
