date: '2021-05-07'
description: Episode 20 of the Shiny Developer series is here! As someone who has
  authored many production grade Shiny applications, I have come to realize that sophisticated
  backend functionality is not the only area one needs to address, it is also the
  end-user experience and how the application is presented. I am thrilled to welcome
  back David Granjon to the Shiny Developer Series to discuss the journey and key
  topics addressed in his brand-new textbook Outstanding User Interfaces with Shiny!  Plus
  David leads us through a comprehensive demonstration of amazing new capabilities
  of the awesome bs4Dash package, part of the RinteRface project. I hope you enjoy
  this episode!
