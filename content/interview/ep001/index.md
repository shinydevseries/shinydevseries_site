description: In this joint production with RStudio Community, I had the pleasure of
  discussing the journey of Shiny and where it is headed in the future with RStudio
  software engineer Winston Chang! We discuss the key events that triggered their
  efforts to make Shiny a production-ready framework, how principles of software design
  are invaluable for creating complex applications, and exciting plans for revamping
  the user interface and new integrations. If you would like to provide feedback or
  ask questions, please visit the dedicated [thread](https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-developer-series-episode-1-follow-up-thread/29491)
