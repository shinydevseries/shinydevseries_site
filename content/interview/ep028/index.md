description: The Shiny Developer Series spotlight on the 2021 Shiny Contest continues
  with episode 28! Eric is joined by statistics lecturer Dr. Kate Saunders to share
  her unique coronaSweeper Shiny application which merges a well-known mini-game in
  the Windows world with modelling the spread of COVID19. On the surface it might
  seem straight-forward, but Kate walks us through her extensive design ideas of the
  algorithms and user experience of the application frontend. This was a very inspiring
  conversation that demonstrates the ways Shiny can be transformative to teaching
  real principles in mathematics, statistics, and beyond!
