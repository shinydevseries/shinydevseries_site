I have a Ph.D. in statistics and am currently working as a Shiny developer at Appsilon, which is a consulting company specializing in developing workflows and unique R Shiny solutions, open-source packages, and machine learning products. Before that I've worked as a data science consultant in companies from different segments as marketing, mobility market, and sales.
