description: In episode 13 of the Shiny Developer Series, we continue our conversation with RStudio software engineer Barrett Schloerke to highlight how you can integrate Shiny apps with custom APIs written in R via the plumber package!  Youâ€™ll see awesome demonstrations of the key features that are part of the brand new plumber 1.0 release, including brand new serializers and parsers for custom objects, a new tidy API compliant with magrittr pipelines, utilizing asynchronous execution, and more.

## Resources mentioned in the episode

* `plumber` allows you to create a web API by merely decorating your existing R source code with `roxygen2` style comments.
  * Site: https://www.rplumber.io/
  * Demos:
    * NEW - Hex logo and website!
    * NEW - pipe-able programatic interface
      * Demo: `plumb(dir = "plumber/pipe") %>% pr_run()`
    * NEW - POST body parsing
      * Process incoming POST body data
      * Ex: HTML forms, multipart forms, csv, tsv, json, yaml, feather and rds.
      * Like serializers, register new POST body parsers
      * Site: https://www.rplumber.io/reference/parsers.html
    * More Serializers!
      * Serialize outgoing route data
      * Ex: plain `text`, `json`, `yaml`, `csv`, `tsv`, `rds`, `feather`
      * NEW - Register image serializers: `svg`, `tiff`, `bmp`, `pdf`. (Pre existing: `png`, `jpeg`)
      * Site: https://www.rplumber.io/reference/serializers.html
    * NEW - Download return values as attachments!
      * Site: https://www.rplumber.io/reference/as_attachment.html
      * Demo: `plumb_api("plumber", "16-attachment") %>% pr_run()`
    * NEW - Async / promises
      * Demo: `plumb("plumber/plumber-future.R") %>% pr_run()`
    * NEW - API UIs (rapidoc)
      * Register new User Interfaces to look at your API
      * Demo: `plumb(dir = "plumber/rapidoc") %>% pr_run()`
  * Thank you to Bruno Tremblay (`@meztez`) for his heavy contributions to plumber!
