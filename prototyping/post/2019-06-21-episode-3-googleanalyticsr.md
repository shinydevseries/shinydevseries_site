description: In this webinar originally broadcast live in partnership with RStudio Community, [Mark Edmondson](https://twitter.com/holomarked) from [IIH Nordic](https://iihnordic.com) joins us to discuss how he incorporated Shiny components such as modules with {googleAnalyticsR} and his other excellent packages. We dive in to some of the technical challenges he had to overcome to provide a clean interface to many Google APIs, the value of open-source contributions to both his work and personal projects, and much more.
