 My name is Luís Gustavo Silva e Silva, and i am a data scientist at the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/home/en). I have a PhD in Statistics with an emphasis on visualizing unstructured and spatial data. I have been working at the Food and Agriculture Organization, one of the United Nations agencies, since 2019. I have developed several real-time indicators and Shiny applications used in FAO to spot and monitor crises across the world. The indicators range from analyzing acceleration in food prices, analyzing countries’ sentiment and how countries are seen worldwide. Before joining the FAO/UN, I’ve worked in different areas such as Public Healthy, Marketing, and Statistics in Medicine (Cardiology Research).
